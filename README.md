# Bank Managment system

A Bank Managment system which allows users to create a bank and register bank accounts.
These accounts can deposit/withdraw money and much more.
The banks can see and access all accounts and shut them down if needed.

Note: This project is a remake, and is not finished.

Future: 
1) Link List implementation to hold bank accounts
2) Use of hash maps
3) Use of a Queue data structure to deal with account inquiries 1 at a time.
